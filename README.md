# Airbnb Availability Checker

This repo contains a service to check the availability of Airbnb listings and notify users when they become available. Currently the repo is currently ðŸš§ in transition ðŸš§ from just a script and some config files to a web app cabable of managing users, their listings, and schedule jobs for checking listings.

Note, the Airbnb API is not public and is only available to verified partners. As such, this repo relies on web scraping tools to check the availability of listings, and is subject to the brittleness that comes with that.
